  storyText: "Turbo walks over to the dumbbell rack and grabs the 190lb set of dumbbells
    and the 200lb set of dumbbells.\n\nHe crosses them on top of each other so he
    can have to in each hand, turns on cannibal corpse to full blast in his headphones,
    and begins to lunge down floor of the gym. \n\nHe soon feels a rumble in the
    ground. The weight's begin falling off racks and the barbells fall form their
    hooks on the walls. \n\nThe rumble quickly turns into a full blown 5.5 magnitude
    earthquake. \n\nHe forgot about one of his biggest weaknesses. The shear strength
    of his legs can leave behind a trail of destruction if he doesn't pay attention.
    This slipped his mind as he got into the cannibal corpse song playing in his
    headphones.\n\nWhat should Turbo do next?\n\n1. Ignore it and continue with his
    set.\n2. Put the weights down and wait for the ground to stop shaking. "
